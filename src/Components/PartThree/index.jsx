                    My first day at school. Who could of known I would end up here coding and
                    programming my way into the world of tech.

                    I was (and still) obsessed with football growing up. Fortunately, I had the
                    opportunity to play for Yeovil FC Academy. During this time I played against a
                    number of academy teams. However, I didn't quite make the cut.

                    I began my first job in Educational Sales at{' '}
                    <a href="https://www.thetrainingroom.com">The Training Room</a>. This was my
                    first exposure to the world of tech. Originallly I began selling Personal
                    Training courses. However, I then moved into selling Software & Web Development
                    training courses. Whilst working at The Training Room I worked with a team of
                    Sales Executives trying to help people change their career's and enter into the
                    world of IT. It was during this time that I started to look into these areas
                    myself and my interest in the sector began to increase.

                  <p>
                    At the start of 2019, I decided to go travelling in Thailand. It was a truly
                    incredible experience and during my time I visited many islands, met people from
                    around the world, many adventure days and of course - went to many bars. During
                    this time it gave me a real chance to reflect on what I wanted to do when I got
                    back home - which is when I started looking into roles in tech.

                  <p>
                    I started learning how to code. I became a regular at <b>CodeAcademy</b> and
                    <b> StackOverFlow.</b> First of all, I started to learn HTML and CSS. I found it
                    incredibly rewarding building something from nothing and having it appear in
                    front of me. I was creating a number of static web pages and trialling different
                    effects and animations that I could use for future websites. I then moved onto
                    basic Javascript. This is when I knew I wanted become a Web Developer and get
                    some professional training and qualifications.

                    </b>{' '}
                    During the course I covered a number of technologies and languages. Such as
                    HTML,CSS,JS, ReactJS, NodeJS and many other skills which you can find on this{' '}

                    This whole experience was a real eye-opener for me. I never thought it would be
                    possible to learn as much as I did during this bootcamp and leave with three
                    fully functional projects.
