                        I was (and still) obsessed with football growing up. Fortunately, I had the
                        opportunity to play for Yeovil FC Academy. During this time I played against
                        a number of academy teams. However, I didn't quite make the cut.

                        I had finished my GCSE's! I managed to get 11 GCSE's all A-C - including an
                        A in Maths, Biology and P.E. So to celebrate my exams, me and a few friends
                        went to Cardiff for the Olympic Games to watch GB take on South Korea.
                        Unfortunately they lost 5-4 on penalties.

                        I began my first job in Educational Sales at{' '}
                        <a href="https://www.thetrainingroom.com">The Training Room</a>. This was my
                        first exposure to the world of tech. Originallly I began selling Personal
                        Training courses. However, I then moved into selling Software & Web
                        Development training courses. Whilst working at The Training Room I worked
                        with a team of Sales Executives trying to help people change their career's
                        and enter into the world of IT. It was during this time that I started to
                        look into these areas myself and my interest in the sector began to
                        increase.

                        At the start of 2019, I decided to go travelling in Thailand. It was a truly
                        incredible experience and during my time I visited many islands, met people
                        from around the world, many adventure days and of course - went to many
                        bars. However, during my time in Asia, it gave me a real chance to reflect
                        on what I wanted to do when I got back home - which is when I started
                        looking into roles in tech.

                        I started learning how to code. I became a regular at <b>CodeAcademy</b> and
                        <b> StackOverFlow.</b> First of all, I started to learn HTML and CSS. I
                        found it incredibly rewarding building something from nothing and having it
                        appear in front of me. I was creating a number of static web pages and
                        trialling different effects and animations that I could use for future
                        websites. I then moved onto basic Javascript. This is when I knew I wanted
                        become a Web Developer and get some professional training and
                        qualifications.
